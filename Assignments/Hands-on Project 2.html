    &lt;h1&gt;Web Browser&lt;/h1&gt;
    A web browser (commonly referred to as a browser) is a software application for retrieving, presenting, and traversing information resources on the World Wide Web. An information resource is identified by a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) and may be a web page, image, video or other piece of content. Hyperlinks present in resources enable users easily to navigate their browsers to related resources.
    &lt;p&gt;Although browsers are primarily intended to use the World Wide Web, they can also be used to access information provided by web servers in private networks or files in file systems.&lt;/P&gt;
    The major web browsers are:
    &lt;!--should contain ul element--&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Google Chrome&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Mozilla Firefox&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Internet Explorer &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Opera&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Safari&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt; 
    &lt;h1&gt;History&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first web browser was invented in 1990 by Sir Tim Berners-Lee. It was called WorldWideWeb and was later renamed Nexus.&lt;p&gt;
    In 1993, browser software was further innovated by Marc Andreessen with the release of Mosaic (later Netscape), &quot;the world&#39;s first popular browser&quot;, which made the World Wide Web system easy to use and more accessible to the average person. Andreesen&#39;s browser sparked the internet boom of the 1990s. The introduction of Mosaic in 1993 - one of the first graphical web browsers - led to an explosion in web use. Andreessen, the leader of the Mosaic team at NCSA, soon started his own company, named Netscape, and released the Mosaic-influenced Netscape Navigator in 1994, which quickly became the world&#39;s most popular browser, accounting for 90% of all web use at its peak (see usage share of web browsers).

    &lt;h2&gt;Benefits&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cascading Style Sheets offer many benefits to web designers. &lt;em class=&quot;emphasis&quot;&gt;CSS lets you separate style information from HTML&lt;/em&gt;, allowing you to provide style sheets for different destination media as your web site requires. You can control the display characteristics of an entire web site with a single style sheet, making maintenance and enhancements of display information a less taxing chore. You can express a wide range of style properties that increase the legibility, accessibility, and delivery of your content. You can build page layouts, either flexible, fixed, or responsive to suit your user and content needs. As you will see in this chapter and through the rest of the book, CSS is easy to learn and apply to your web design projects.&lt;/p&gt;
