<h1>A bit About David Sairai</h1>
<!-- Who am I section -->
<h2>Who Am I</h2>
My name is David Sairai and I am originally from Zimbabwe and been a resident citizen of the city of Cape Town since 2012. I currently work as an IT Support Engineer for a UK-based software company in Stellenbosch and have worked in various IT roles in Johannesburg, Cape Town and Harare my home city. 

<p>I had a weird start to my IT career. Started off at a Catholic boarding school called St Ignatius with ZX Spectrum and commodore (thank you, Fr. Wolfe). Then when varsity fell short as I didn tmeet the required grades to do a degree, I moved into the employment field in the fast food area, then moved “up” the ladder to being a cashier at various retail stores.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, I was busy studying in IT part-time at night at a college in town when one day during my lunch break as I was doing my college homework, a gentleman came in at my workplace to buy some electrical cable. He asked me what I was doing, and I replied that I was doing my college homework. We had a brief chat and after seeing my college homework and IT textbooks, he said he has an opening at his company and if I am interested to join his company as a IT Software Assistant. Suffice to say, I resigned from that job the following day to enter the IT world.</p>

<p>I started to my work in Linux and Windows 3.1, then moved i to various SysAdmin roles for various companies, including some public listed companies where I got involved and learnt various software, platforms and applications. I then bounced down under to SA when I got a job in Johannesburg where I travelled all over SA overseeing the rollout of a Microsoft Retail POS system in various retail outlets. IN 2012, I public listed comany headed hunted me on Linkedin and I relocated to Cape Town where i worked for five years befoe moving to an american global IT company for another two years where I learnt a lot about being humble, disciplined and pushing yourself to make your own career. This year I moved to Stellenbosch to a new role where I am currently at.</p>

<h2>My Roadmap to Studying</h2>

In 2021, I enrolled for the Diploma in Information Technology through the University of South Africa as I wanted to add a formal qualification. Even though I have been certifying myself in various vendor based certifications in the past ten years of my IT career, a formal qualification will enable me to proceed doing a degree in Information Technology hopefully through the same university. God willing, I would want to continue to add the Masters qualification thereafter as this will give me an added advantage to get into managerial roles in the corporate world.

 <!-- All about the blog section -->
<h2>About The Blog</h2>
This blog will serve as journal of my progression in attaining this qualification and will be updated reguarly to keep you my avid readers of how I am doing. It has been designed using the basic knowledge of HTML and CSS which is the foundation of web development.  Thank you for reading it and feel free to comment on about it.
