<!--What I learnt in Chapter 1-->
<h1>Chapter 1 - HTML</h1>
This chapter looks at the history of the World Wide Web and HTML or Hypertext Markup Language. HTML is rendered by using software called web browsers such as but not limited to Internet Explorer, Google Chrome or Firefox to display content be it in the form of words, pictures, sounds or video. The current version of HTML, HTML5 uses tags which must be correctly applied to follow the rules laid out by the of the World Wide Web Consortium or W3C. I also learn the use of a validator to make sure it meets the W3C standards. HTML has mains sections called the head and body sections and in between the various tags are applied to make up the web page with opening and closing tags. 

<p>Some of these tags are as follows</p>
    <li>&lt;html&gt;</li>
    <li>&lt;head&gt;</li>
    <li>&lt;title&gt;</li>
    <li>&lt;body&gt;</li>
</ul>

    &lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Web Browser&lt;/h1&gt;
A web browser (commonly referred to as a browser) is a software application for retrieving, presenting, and traversing information resources on the World Wide Web. An information resource is identified by a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) and may be a web page, image, video or other piece of content. Hyperlinks present in resources enable users easily to navigate their browsers to related resources.
&lt;p&gt;Although browsers are primarily intended to use the World Wide Web, they can also be used to access information provided by web servers in private networks or files in file systems.&lt;/P&gt;
The major web browsers are:
&lt;!--should contain ul element--&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Google Chrome&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Mozilla Firefox&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Internet Explorer &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Opera&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Safari&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;h1&gt;History&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first web browser was invented in 1990 by Sir Tim Berners-Lee. It was called WorldWideWeb and was later renamed Nexus.&lt;p&gt;
In 1993, browser software was further innovated by Marc Andreessen with the release of Mosaic (later Netscape), "the world's first popular browser", which made the World Wide Web system easy to use and more accessible to the average person. Andreesen's browser sparked the internet boom of the 1990s. The introduction of Mosaic in 1993 - one of the first graphical web browsers - led to an explosion in web use. Andreessen, the leader of the Mosaic team at NCSA, soon started his own company, named Netscape, and released the Mosaic-influenced Netscape Navigator in 1994, which quickly became the world's most popular browser, accounting for 90% of all web use at its peak (see usage share of web browsers).

<p>To make your web pages look more pleasant and uniform if you have a uniform outlook across multiple web pages, CSS can be in the web document or as an external document called a style sheet. It controls the way the webpage or website looks or feels by defining it using the same code throughout</p>

    &lt;meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;charset=UTF-8"&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Cascading Style Sheets&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation semantics (the look and formatting) of a document written in a markup language. Its most common application is to style web pages written in HTML and XHTML, but the language can also be applied to any kind of XML document.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CSS is designed primarily to enable the separation of document content (written in HTML or a similar markup language) from document presentation, including elements such as the layout, colors, and fonts. This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple pages to share formatting, and reduce complexity and repetition in the structural content (such as by allowing for tableless web design). CSS can also allow the same markup page to be presented in different styles for different rendering methods, such as onscreen, in print, by voice (when read out by a speech-based browser or screen reader) and on Braille-based, tactile devices. It can also be used to allow the web page to display differently depending on the screen size or device on which it is being viewed. While the author of a document typically links that document to a CSS file, readers can use a different style sheet, perhaps one on their own computer, to override the one the author has specified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CSS specifies a priority scheme to determine which style rules apply if more than one rule matches against a particular element. In this so-called cascade, priorities or weights are calculated and assigned to rules, so that the results are predictable.&lt;/p&gt;

<!--What I learnt in Chapter 2-->
<h1>Chapter 2 - WEB SITE DESIGN PRINCIPLES</h1>

<p>In this chapter I learnt that websites must not only be user friendly but accessible to those with disabilities and be viewable across many devices and browsers. When designing a website, one must know who they are targeting, i.e., the audience, run tests to make user that it meets the standards set out by W3C for browser compatibility and standards and also on different browsers and devices. </P>

<p>Due to different social structures in the world, one must take in consideration the different types of internet access available im society therefore a webpage which loads of media and graphics will be problematic if the internet is slow. The internet connection speed has to be factored in when designing your website so that you audience doesnâ€™t feel left out when viewing your website as some graphics may fail to load properly. This can be also be avoided by using the browser cache which allows the storing of reusable content and having the same look and feel each time they view your website as the content is not downloaded again from your website thereby making it load quickly. <p>

<p>I also learnt that because as there are many devices and operating systems in use, one must take this into consideration to make sure to test on as many devices as possible. Also, these devices come with different screen sizes and color so a desktop screen size and color will differ with that of mobile devices. Due the various screen sizes, you may design a website that is responsive or a separate mobile site. The web server will detect which device is been used to view the website and will redirect the user to either the mobile or desktop website but the major drawback of this implimenation is the duplication of the work to be done on both mobile and desktop sites.</p>

<p>One way to get around this is to have a responsive design which will respond to screen sizes by using CSS styles.</p>

<p> The ease of use, access to information and the look and feel is what I learnt must also be taken into consideration in web designing. The look and feel of a web site should be uniform throughout such as the navigation style menus placement and layout of the content. We must also think of people with disabilities so that the accessibility features are included in the design of the website.<p>

<!--What I learnt in Chapter 3-->    
<h1>Chapter 3 - SITE PLANNING</h1>

<p>In this chapter I learnt when designing a website, one may plan by using various tools such paper and pen or software. You must taken into consideration the various stages of each design and timelines so that it is completed on time. Questions have to be asked as to the needs, wants or the target audience. Below are the steps to be taken to plan your website in the Web development project lifecycle</P>

<ul>
    <li>Gather as much information about the what is required from the users as possible, are there people with disabilities, do you need programmers, </li>
    <li>Structure of the site is important such as navigation and menus to be used.  </li>
    <li>Do a layout for the website and the various pages to be included in the website which will end up being a final design called a wireframe </li>
    <li>Develop and test loading of content by testing to see its performance and </li>
    <li>Allow the users to test the site, validate it to make sure that it meets the W3C standards and testing it on various devices and browsers </li>
    <li>Publish the website either on the web or internally depending on the target audience and run marketing campaigns on various media platforms </li>
    <li>Update the site regular to keep the target audience informed and also to add or remove any features as when required</li>
</ul>

<p>When you gathered your information, the end results will determine how you design what type of website. For example, a blogging site is different from a wiki or an online shopping site. All these are different and have different requirements and target audiences. You must also know how your website is performing by gathering viewer statistics such who is viewing it, how long, which page if viewed the most, geographical area, browser and devices used by using web analytics. </p> 

<p>Depending on the size of the web site, a web site team maybe put together and these team members can include the following:</p>

<ul> 
    <li>Project management </li>
    <li>HTML developers</li>
    <li>Designers </li>
    <li>Writers and information designers</li>
    <li>Application developers </li>
    <li>Database administrators </li>
    <li>Server administrators </li>
</ul>

<p>A website must also have a uniform structure throughout and take the form of the following structures:</p>

<ul> 
    <li>Linear Structure</li>
    <li>Tutorial Structure </li>
    <li>Web Structure</li>
    <li>Cluster Structure</li>
    <li>Catalog Structure</li>
    <li>Hierarchal Structure</li>
</ul>

<p>Finally, one must not forget to include the file naming convention to as it will depend on the web server to be used to host the website, case sensitivity, character exceptions and file types. File names must not include spaces, special characters, and try to use lowercase on file names. I learnt that you must have a proper file structure for your files to be stored on the web server. Once you are ready to publish your website, look for a reliable hosting service provider who will meet your website requirements, register a domain name that will point to your website and have ongoing tests and maintenance of the site to keep your target audience.</p>

<!--What I learnt in Chapter 4-->
<h1>Chapter 4 - CASCADING STYLE SHEETS</h1>

<p> Cascading Style Sheets or CSS is a language used on websites which is responsible for the look and feel of the website. I learnt that there are three types of ways to use CSS and these are as follows:<p>

<ul>
    <li>Internal Style</li>
    <li>External Style</li>
    <li>Inline Style</li>
</ul>

<p>All the above three styles use style rules to define an HTML element and a set of rules is called a style sheet. Below is a simple use of the three types of CSS styles:</p>

<pre>
    <code>
        &lt;!--Sample HTML document with the Three Types Of Styles --&gt;
        &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
        &lt;html lang="en"&gt;
            &lt;head&gt;
            &lt;title&gt;Use of CSS in HTML&lt;/title&gt;
            &lt;!--Internal Style --&gt;
            &lt;style&gt;
            h1 {color:blue;font-family:verdana;border:thin solid;}
            body {font-family:arial;}
            &lt;/style&gt;
            &lt;!--Link style --&gt;
            &lt;link href="styles.css" rel="stylesheet"&gt;
            &lt;!--Inline Styles--&gt;
            &lt;h1 style="color: blue;"&gt;David Sairai&lt;/h1&gt;
        &lt;meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;charset=UTF-8"&gt;
           &lt;/head&gt;
        &lt;/body&gt;
    </code>
</pre>

<p>A style rule consists of two parts: a selector and a declaration. A selector determines the element to which the rule is applied whilst a declaration is containing with in curly brackets to and details the exact property values</p>

<ul>
    <li>Internal Style is only used for that web page <strong>ONLY</strong> and is created in the &lt;head&gt;section of the document. </li>
    <li>External Style is used is in an external document and can be linked to multiple webpages to provide uniformity across different properties such type of font, color, size of font, background color, etc. You use the &lt;link&gt; element to be located in the &lt;head&gt; section of the affected document to link the external CSS document to the HTML document. 
    <li>Inline style is used to affect a single element in the document and takes precedence over any other style used on the webpage. </li>
</ul>

<p>One must write code that properly tabbed and use comments to describe each style as much possible to provide information to the next designer what each style is for.</p>

<p>Elements in a HTML document are structured in a hierarchal format of parent and child elements where the &lt;html&gt; is the parent element and in the it are child elements such &lt;head&gt; and &lt;body&gt; elements. CSS properties are inherited from parent elements to child elements in what is called inheritance. </p>

<p>This chapter also covered some basic of selection techniques namely</p>

<ul>
    <li>Using type selectors â€“ when you apply every element in the document </li>
    <li>Grouping selectors - when group style using the same rules</li>
    <li>Combining declarations - when you use trhe same slector with many property declarations </li>
    <li>Using descendant selectors - when you sue selctor that is descendant of other element</li>
    <li>Universal Selector - when you apply a style rule to a group of elements</li>
</ul>

<p>I also learnt that there are different selectors that can be used to to define each element in the document. </p>
