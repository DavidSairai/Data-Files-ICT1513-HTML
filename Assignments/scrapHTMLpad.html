<p>Hello Bhekamagwala</p>

<p>Great blog though I did not see images in it. You can use the <strong>img</strong> HTML element to get images onto your website. You can sign up for a free storage service from Microsoft called <a href="https://onedrive.com">OneDrive</a> and upload your pictures there. You then share the images&nbsp;in your OneDrive account and paste the URLs into your site. That way the images will always who up on your site.</p>

<p>Good luck!</p>
